# Suet Recipes
## Trial and Error

The below outlines both recipes and experience making suet cakes for birds. I tried various combinations of ingredients in order to see what holds up best.

## Recipe 1 - Agar Agar Suet (7/10)
    - Water: 1 1/2 cup
    - Agar Agar: 2 Tablespoons
    - Bird Seed: 5 cups
    - Flour: 2 Tablespoons
    - Sugar: 2 Tablespoons

### Instructions
1. Boil the water and dissolve the agar agar in it, stirring continuously.
2. Dissolve the sugar in the hot mixture.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the bird seed and flour.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring continuously.
5. Pour the mixture into molds or containers and let it set until firm.

### Results
The agar agar mixture set well and produced firm suet cakes. Birds seemed to enjoy them, and they held up well in outdoor conditions, although they were a bit softer than traditional suet.

## Recipe 2 - Pectin Suet (1/10)
    - Water: 1 cup
    - Pectin: 6 Tablespoons
    - Bird Seed: 5 cups
    - Flour: 2 Tablespoons
    - Vinegar: 1 Tablespoon

### Instructions
1. Combine hot water and the pectin. Stir until dissolved.
2. Add the vinegar to the liquid mixture.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the bird seed and flour.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring continuously.
5. Pour the mixture into molds or containers and let it set until firm.

### Results
The pectin mixture lacked firmness. The suet cakes did not hold together and crumbled apart. Birds seemed to enjoy them, but they did not last as long in outdoor conditions.
