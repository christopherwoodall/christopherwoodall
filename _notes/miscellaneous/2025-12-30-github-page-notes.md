In order to enable Jekyll add a [`_config.yaml`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to the root of your repository.

If you want to display a separate page on GitHub then the one rendered as your default page then move your `README.md` to the `.github/` directory and create an `index.html` file (make sure to translate any markdown to html) in the root of the repository.
