# Tissue Culture

Plant propagation has always been fascinating. From the [Nuclear Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_gardening) and [Rio Red Grapefruit](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/science/28crop.html) of the 1970s to the [glowing petunias](https://light.bio/) of today, there has always been something interesting about growing plants.

Another fascination of mine is artificial reward systems - like in game economies. From ["Destroying the Economy on Minecraft's WORST Pay-to-Win Server"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKvAo9rzv5g) to ["How the Runescape Economy Works! (and how to take advantage!)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYvsxgTzQTU) fake incentive markets are my version of murder mystery podcasts. So when a video entitled ["I accidentally crashed the rare plant market "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dk3uSLxMI4) came across my feed it peaked my interests. Enough so to invest in a [kit](https://plantsinjars.shop/) and try it myself.

## The Setup

- 1x Digital Scale
- Microwave Safe Glass Measuring Cups
- 100ml Distilled Water
- 10 50ml Plastic Centrifuge Tubes with Screw Cap
- 1x [Plants in Jar Starter Kit](https://plantsinjars.shop/products/starter-kit)

## The Recipe (100ml)

Sterlizing the media is **very** important, but busting out a pressure cooker might be too much. We will use a mixture of microwave and [chemical sterlization](https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-full-text-pdf/A50633F60394) for this run. If it fails then we will look into a more proper setup.

This first batch will be a small artisanal brew for testing purposes. Each tube will get 10ml of media solution.

### Ingredients
- 100ml Distilled Water
- 0.45g MS Medium
- 3.00g Sugar
- 0.05ml BAP (1mg/ml)
- 0.01ml NAA (1mg/ml)
- 0.70g Agar
- 0.04ml Bleach(6%)

### Process
1. Combine the MS powder, sucrose, and hormone stocks (BAP and NAA) in approximately 80 mL of distilled water.

2. Stir until fully dissolved.

3. Adjust pH to 5.7: This step is critical; if the pH is incorrect, the bleach will not effectively sterilize the media or may become toxic to the plants.

4. Add distilled water until the total volume reaches exactly 100 mL.

5. Add the agar to the mixture.

5. Heat the solution (microwave or stovetop) just until it boils and the liquid becomes transparent.

6. Add 0.4mL of a 1:10 diluted bleach solution (created by mixing 1ml fresh bleach with 9ml water).

7. Swirl vigorously for 30 seconds to ensure the chlorine is evenly distributed.

8. Quickly dispense 10 mL of the liquid media into each of your 10 tubes.

9. Leave the caps slightly loose for 15 minutes. This "off-gassing" period allows excess chlorine gas to escape, preventing chemical damage to your plant tissue.

10. Tighten the caps once the media has gelled.

## First Run

Next we monitor the tubes for 24 hours. Tubes should be clear. If there is any sign of discoloration or fuzziness it indicates a failed sanitization process and we will need to adjust our sterilization method.
