# Tissue Culture

Plant propagation has always been fascinating. From the [Nuclear Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_gardening) and [Rio Red Grapefruit](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/science/28crop.html) of the 1970s to the [glowing petunias](https://light.bio/) of today, there has always been something interesting about growing plants.

A guilty pleasure of mine is, and has been, watching YouTube videos of people crashing fake economies. From ["Destroying the Economy on Minecraft's WORST Pay-to-Win Server"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKvAo9rzv5g) to ["How the Runescape Economy Works! (and how to take advantage!)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYvsxgTzQTU) fake financial markets are my version of murder mystery podcasts. So when a video entitled ["I accidentally crashed the rare plant market "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dk3uSLxMI4) came across my feed it peaked my interests. Enough so to invest in a [kit](https://plantsinjars.shop/pages/protocol-documents) and try it myself.

## The Recipe (100ml)

Sterlizing the media is **very** important, but busting out a pressure cooker might be too much. We will use a mixture of microwave and [chemical sterlization](https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-full-text-pdf/A50633F60394) for this run. If it fails then we will look into a more proper setup.

This first batch will be a small artisanal brew for testing purposes. Each tube will get 10ml of media solution.
