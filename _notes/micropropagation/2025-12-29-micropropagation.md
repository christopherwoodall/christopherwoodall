# Plant Tissue Culture: Micropropagation Fundamentals

This guide summarizes the standardized protocols and chemical logic for micropropagation, structured for repeatable laboratory success.

## 1. Phytohormone Logic (The Controllers)
Growth in a sterile environment is governed by the ratio of Auxins to Cytokinins.

* **Cytokinins (Shooting):** Includes **BAP** (6-Benzylaminopurine), Kinetin, and Zeatin. These signal the plant to divide cells and form stems and leaves.
* **Auxins (Rooting):** Includes **IBA** (Indole-3-butyric acid) and **NAA** (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid). These signal the plant to stop leaf production and start growing roots.
* **Gibberellins (Elongation):** Primarily **GA3**, used to stretch internodes if shoots are too clumped.

## 2. The Three Stages of Micropropagation


### Stage I: Establishment (Initiation)
* **Goal:** Successfully transition a sterile piece of plant tissue (explant) into the media.
* **Chemistry:** High Cytokinin to Low Auxin ratio (typically **10:1**) to "wake up" the tissue.

### Stage II: Multiplication (Cloning)
* **Goal:** Break apical dominance to force the production of multiple side-shoots.
* **Chemistry:** Increase or maintain high Cytokinin levels. One plant can be divided into many every 4–6 weeks.


### Stage III: Rooting (Independence)
* **Goal:** Trigger the base of the shoots to grow roots for soil survival.
* **Chemistry:** Flip the ratio to Low Cytokinin and High Auxin (**1:10**).

## 3. Standard Media Formulations (Per 1 Liter)
A consistent base provides life support while hormones provide the instructions.

| Ingredient | Amount | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MS Salts** | 4.44g | Baseline nutrients and vitamins. |
| **Sucrose** | 30.00g | Carbon/energy source (replaces photosynthesis). |
| **Agar** | 7.00g | Gelling agent to hold the plant upright. |
| **pH** | 5.7 | Critical for nutrient bioavailability. |

> **Pro-Tip:** For the Rooting Stage, many protocols reduce **MS Salts to 2.22g** (Half-Strength) to encourage the plant to search for nutrients by growing more roots.

## 4. Sterilization Protocols

### Explant Surface Sterilization (The 10% Bleach Bath)
1.  **Solution:** Mix 1 part household bleach with 9 parts water (**1:9 ratio**).
2.  **Surfactant:** Add a small drop of dish soap to help the solution penetrate crevices.
3.  **Agitation:** Soak tissue for 10–30 minutes depending on size (Monstera nodes need longer than Petunia leaves).
4.  **Rinse:** Rinse the tissue 3 times in sterile water before placing it in the jar.


### Aseptic Technique
* **Tools:** Spray all scissors and forceps with **70% alcohol** between every cut.
* **Environment:** Work only in a Still Air Box (SAB) or Flow Hood.
* **Media Sterility:** Pressure cook all media at **15 PSI for 15 minutes**.

## 5. Species-Specific Modifications

| Protocol | Explant | Primary Hormones (Stage I & II) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Houseplant** | Node | 1.0mg BAP / 0.1mg IBA | Great starting point for Pothos/Philodendron. |
| **Monstera** | Node | 5.0mg BAP / 0.1mg NAA | Requires very high BAP to overcome dormancy. |
| **Petunia** | Leaf | 1.0mg BAP (No Auxin) | Direct organogenesis from leaf halves. |

## 6. Troubleshooting (Debugging Growth)
* **Browning/Oxidation:** If tissue ends turn brown, trim 0.5 cm off with a sterile blade before subculturing.
* **Vitrification:** If plants look "glassy" or water-logged, increase the Agar concentration to 8.0g.
* **Persistent Mold:** Increase the initial soap wash or add 5–10 minutes to the bleach soak time.

## Alternative Sterilization Methods

### The Microwave Process:

1. **Containers:** 4 oz polypropylene cups are used. Glass flasks can also be used as long as they have no metal [01:05].

2. **Settings:** The lids must be left loose to prevent melting. The presenter runs the microwave at 50% power for 5 minutes, though this varies based on microwave wattage and cup size [02:03].

3. **Efficiency:** The microwave sterilized 50 cups in about 25 minutes total (across three batches), whereas a large pressure cooker would take approximately 2 hours for a similar volume [02:23].
