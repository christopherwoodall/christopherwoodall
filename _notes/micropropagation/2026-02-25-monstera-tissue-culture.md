Here are some photos from my first attempt at creating a monstera tissue culture. 

I started with a fairly large vine cutting.

From that we were able to extract 6-ish explants - 5 with eyes and one very young node.

The explants were then sterilized and placed in the growth medium.

After that we divided them in half, with 3 cultures going inside a uranium glass vessle.

I'll update as time goes on - unless they all crash in which case I'll probably just delete this post and pretend it never happened.
