I've been exploring **Resurrection Biology** (or "Lazarus" Biology) - a hip-sounding pop-science label for reviving organisms from dormancy. This isn't [new](https://www.jurassicpark.com/) - viable seeds have been germinated after [thousands of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldest_viable_seed) - but defining the "form" helps to concretize the concept.

A good example of this is the [resurrection plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_plant), a desert specialist capable of surviving near total desiccation for years.

Beyond physical desiccation, chemical dormancy can also be broken. Revitalizing old seeds using [Gibberellic Acid (GA3)](https://www.uaf.edu/afes/places/gbg/research/files/pdfs/2011.-Holloway.-Note-43.GA_.pdf) triggers germination by mimicking the plant's natural growth signals.

The most interesting part about this is not the chemical itself but its discovery. It starts in the 1930s with a fungal disease affecting rice plants in Japan, colloquially known as [Foolish Seedling Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakanae). The fungus, [*Gibberella fujikuroi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibberella_fujikroi), induces an overproduction of [gibberellic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibberellic_acid) in the host - causing it to grow excessively tall, spindly, and weak.

While a *foolish* trait for a rice farmer, it is a useful tool for horticulturists. My *Mimosa pudica* seeds are likely non-viable now, but understanding the phytohormone logic is vital for future micropropagation experiments.
