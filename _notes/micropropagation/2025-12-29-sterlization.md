1. **Containers:** 4 oz polypropylene cups are used. Glass flasks can also be used as long as they have no metal [01:05].

2. **Settings:** The lids must be left loose to prevent melting. The presenter runs the microwave at 50% power for 5 minutes, though this varies based on microwave wattage and cup size [02:03].

3. **Efficiency:** The microwave sterilized 50 cups in about 25 minutes total (across three batches), whereas a large pressure cooker would take approximately 2 hours for a similar volume [02:23].
