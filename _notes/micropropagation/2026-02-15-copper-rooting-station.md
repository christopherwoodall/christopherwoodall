I noticed that the water in the rooting station would get cloudy quickly, most likely due to fertilizers and other cytohormones used in the micropropagation process. I decided to add a small piece of copper to the water, as copper has antimicrobial properties that can help keep the water clean and prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi.

This is how the rooting station looked before I added the copper.

I bent some copper into the shape of a small candy cane in order to place over the lip of the test tubes.

After that I replaced the water. I did not  clean the test tubes, so the copper is now in contact with the fertilizer residue that was already in the tubes. I then added the copper canes to the tubes and placed them back in the rooting station.

Over the past few weeks I have noticed that the water has stayed much clearer - even when using fertilizer or other cytohormones. I will continue to monitor the rooting station and update this post with any further observations.

Overall, I am very happy with the results so far and I will continue to use copper in my rooting stations.

**Note:** I am not a scientist and this is just an experiment. I have not done any research on the use of copper in rooting stations, so I cannot say for certain that it is effective or safe.
