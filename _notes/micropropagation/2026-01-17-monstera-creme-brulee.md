I recently acquired 5 [Monstera Creme Brulee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monstera/comments/rmj7fg/what_is_the_difference_between_thai_constellation/) tissue culture plants. This is my attempt at propagating and documenting the process.


These are from [PlantyTimeShop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4380410412/monstera-creme-brulee-pack-of-5-us) on Etsy. This is my first time working with this vendor but I would order again. The plants arrived in good condition with no signs of contamination.

We used these [nursery pots with humidity domes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B09XKFMFTZ) from Amazon along with coco coir and a little bit of potting soil(this is apperently a no-no) as the growing medium.

I forgot to take pictures of the intermediate steps but the process is pretty straight forward. Remove the plants from the container and gently wash them under running water to remove any residual medium. You can also soak them and gently agitate to help remove stubborn medium. Finally, plant them in the prepared nursery pots.

The humidity domes came with small ventilation holes so I made some [small caps](/assets/notes/micropropagation/2026-01-17-monstera-creme-brulee/2026-01-17-monstera-creme-brulee-humidity-dome-caps.stl) to put on top and 3D printed them out.

Here's how it looks with all of the caps on.

Fingers crossed for successful propagation!
